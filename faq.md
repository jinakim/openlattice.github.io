## Is Loom HIPAA and CJIS compliant?

Loom infrastructure is HIPAA and CJIS compliant and we are capable of signing HIPAA BAAs for storing data. We comply with HIPAA Security Rule by ensuring PHI is encrypted in transit and at rest with industry-standard standard encryption. We also support disaster recovery by securely storing live snapshots of the database system that we can recover quickly from backup.

## Can I control what data I share?

Yes, you can choose to set permissions per entity set and per property for any dataset you own. Individuals can request access to read your datasets, or may be automatically granted access if assigned a role with permissions. We also support de-identification so you can share with outside organizations and researchers, while still retaining access to the full data.

## How much does Loom cost?
All of Loom's baseline services used for Data Driven Justice are **free**. This includes:
* Making datasets available for download
* Removing PII through de-identification
* Linking and Merging across multiple datasets
* Creating Timelines and Visualizations
