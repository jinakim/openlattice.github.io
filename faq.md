## Is Loom HIPAA and CJIS compliant?

Loom infrastructure is compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS). We are also capable of signing HIPAA Business Associate Agreements (BAAs) for storing data. We comply with HIPAA Security Rule by ensuring PHI is encrypted in transit and at rest with industry-standard standard encryption. We also support disaster recovery by securely storing live snapshots of the database system that we can recover quickly from backup.

## Can I control what data I share?

Yes, you retain ownership of the data you upload and can set permissions on the data per property type. Individuals can request access to read your datasets, or you can automatically assign permissions using Roles you define in your organization. We also support de-identification so you can easily share data with outside stakeholders.
