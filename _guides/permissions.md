## Requesting permissions

If you require access to an Entity Set on Loom, you need to request permission from the Entity Set's owner. Any property you do not have permission to view will be marked with a lock icon.

{% include image.html caption="No access to properties" path="guides/permissions-lock-icons.png" %}

You can request permission to view certain properties through the Actions menu

{% include image.html caption="Actions Menu" path="guides/permissions-request.png" %}

Just select which properties you want access to.

{% include image.html caption="Requesting Permissions" path="guides/permissions-request-properties.png" %}

Once the owner approves the request, you will be able to view data for those properties.

## Granting permissions

When a user requests permission to view an Entity Set you own, a Permissions Request will appear
at the top of the Details page for your Entity Set.

{% include image.html caption="Permission Requests" path="guides/permissions-grant-request.png" %}

Accepting the permissions request will give read access to the user requesting the data. You can also review the properties they requested before deciding to allow permission.
