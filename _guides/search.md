## Browsing the Catalog

You can search for datasets by keyword (Search Term) or you can search by
Property or Entity Type if you know this information already. If you search
for the keyword "sample", you will see that you already have read access
to 3 sample datasets. These datasets contain fake data that you can use to
experiment with the Loom platform.

## Searching property values

Click **View Details** for the Sample Jail Data. Once you're on the dataset's
overview page, click **Search this entity set**. Since you have been given **Read** access to the entity set and all of its properties, you can search
for property values. For example, searching "Caroline" will return all people
in the dataset with the name "Caroline", including names that are phonetically
sound similar to it, such as "Kirlin" or "Karoline".
