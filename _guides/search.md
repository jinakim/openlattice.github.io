## Browsing the Catalog

You can search for datasets by keyword (Search Term) or you can search by
Property or Entity Type if you know this information already. If you search
for the keyword "sample", you will see that you already have read access
to a few demo datasets. These datasets contain fake data that you can use to
explore some of the features of the Loom platform.

## Searching property values

Start by clicking on **View Details** for the Sample Jail Subjects. 
Once you're on the dataset's
overview page, click **Search this entity set**. Sample Jail Subjects is a public dataset, so you have been given **Read** access to the dataset and all of its properties. This allows you to search for property values in the dataset. 

For example, searching "Caroline" will return all people
in the dataset with the name "Caroline", including names that are phonetically
sound similar to it, such as "Kirlin" or "Karoline".

**Pro tip:** Typing `*` (the star or asterisk symbol) is a simple search query you can use to return all rows in a dataset.
