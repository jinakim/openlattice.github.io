## Create a new Organization

Once you have an organization, you can create custom roles and assign permissions per role.

To create an organization, go to **Organizations** and click **Create New Organization**. Fill in the name and description for your organization. You can also set whether you want your organization to be visible in search by marking it as **Public**.

## Specify Domains

You can add a **Domain** to automatically approve members who request to join with an approved email address. For example, adding `thedataloom.com` will automatically approve user requests from `user@thedataloom.com` email addresses.

## Create Roles

You can add custom roles within your organization. These roles can be assigned to users, so you can grant and revoke permissions on a per-role basis.

## Add Members

Easily search for members to add to your organization by name or email.

## Assign Roles

Once you've created roles and added members to your team, you can assign roles to individuals and use them to bulk add permissions to members in your organization.
