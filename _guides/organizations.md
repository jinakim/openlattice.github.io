## Create a new Organization

Once you have an organization, you can create custom roles within your organization and assign permissions per role.

To create an organization, go to **Organizations** and click **Create New Organization**. Fill in the name and description for your organization. You can also indicate whether you want your organization to be visible in search by marking it as **Public**.

## Specify Domains

Adding **Domains** will automatically approve members who request to join your organization using those domains.

## Create Roles

You can add custom roles within your organization. These roles can be assigned to users, so you can grant and revoke permissions on a per-role basis.

## Add Members

Simply search for members by name or email, and add them to your organization.

## Assign Roles

Once you've created roles and added members to your team, you can assign roles to individuals and use them to bulk add permissions to members in your organization.
