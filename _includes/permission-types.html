| Field    | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|
| Owner    | Owners can **read**, **write**, and **link** datasets. They can also **delete** any dataset they own. The user who integrates the data for a dataset will be listed as a dataset owner by default. New owners can be added or removed only by other dataset owners. |
| Write    | Users with **write** permissions can add new data to the dataset. This permission is often assigned to users who need to perform [data integrations](/guides/integrations/). **Write permissions must be granted on a dataset and each of its properties to complete a data integration.** |
| Read (Datasets)     | Users with **read** permissions on a dataset can find the dataset in search results and view a list of its property names and descriptions. **If a user _only_ has read permissions on a dataset (and not its properties) they will not be able to read the property values.** |
| Read (Per Property)     | Users with **read** permissions on a property can read and search for values of that property. |
| Link (Dataset)     | Users with **link** permissions on a dataset will be able to use the specified dataset for linking. [Learn about setting permissions for linking datasets.](#setting-permissions-for-linking-datasets) |
| Link (Per Property)     | Users with **link** permissions on a property can use the specified properties to link datasets. [Learn about setting permissions for linking datasets.](#setting-permissions-for-linking-datasets) |
